    "content": "First ATODescription:Account Takeover (ATO) is a critical security vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a legitimate user’s account. This can occur through various attack vectors, such as weak authentication mechanisms, credential stuffing, password reset flaws, insecure direct object references (IDOR), or session hijacking. Once access is gained, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user, leading to severe consequences such as unauthorized transactions, data theft, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the application.In this scenario, I found that I could take over another user’s account by manipulating the response and brute-forcing the verification code.POC:1- I tried to register using my email address that i have registered before,•\tApplication responds with “The Email has already been taken” error2- I intercepted the response (via Burp/Proxy) and replace the error message with {“status”: true,”status_code”:200,”message”:”user registered successfully”}” and replace the response code to HTTP/2 200 OK• And here’s the surprise: the server accepted the request (HTTP 200) and sent a 4-digit verification code to the victim’s email, which forwarded me to the next page.3- I tried to brute-forces the 4-digit code (10,000 possible combinations) using burp intruder and Successful verification leads to account takeover.Once I realized that the application had no server-side validation, I tried to perform another ATO using different functions.In the second scenario, we can reproduce a different situation in the ‘forgot password’ function by manipulating the response as well.1- Go to forget password and put email you want to change its password.2- Write any invalid OTP.   (BTW we can also brute force the OTP here as we did in registeration page )3- Intercept the response in Burp .4-You will get the following response4- Change the response code  to 200 ok and error message to “{“status”:true,”status_code”:200,”message”:”Account verified successfully”}” .5- send the response.And here we are, we can now change the victim’s password to new password.Third scenario , in the forget password function we can reproduce a different scenario•\tGo to forget password and put your email.•\tWrite the valid OTP from your email.•\tYou will be redirected to a page where you can enter the new password•\tWrite the new password and intercept the request in burp then send it to repeater and change your email with victim email then the victim password changed."
