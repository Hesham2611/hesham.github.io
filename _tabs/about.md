Hi, I’m Hesham Saleh, a passionate Cyber Security Engineer with a solid foundation in web development. I specialize in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

I hold a Professional Cyber Security Diploma from the Information Technology Institute (ITI), where I developed a strong understanding of security challenges and solutions. I’m currently working as a Cyber Security Engineer at ZeroSploit and I have previously worked as a Cyber Security Frontline Engineer at Vodafone. Additionally, I am an instructor at DEPI, NTI, Global Knowledge and We Innovate, where I mentor and train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.

My expertise extends to areas such as penetration testing, network security, and risk assessment. I also have hands-on experience in web vulnerabilities and web application penetration testing (eWPTXv3) and (eWPTv2). 

I’m constantly seeking innovative ways to enhance security practices and collaborate with teams to solve complex problems. I am deeply committed to maintaining the highest standards of security integrity and contributing to organizational growth through cybersecurity solutions.
